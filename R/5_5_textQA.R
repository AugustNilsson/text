#' Question Answering STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT
#' @param question (string)  A question
#' @param context (string)  The context(s) where the model will look for the answer.
#' @param model (string)  HuggingFace name of a pre-trained language model that have been fine-tuned on a question answering task.
#' @param device (string)  Device to use: 'cpu', 'gpu', or 'gpu:k' where k is a specific device number
#' @param tokenizer_parallelism (boolean)  If TRUE this will turn on tokenizer parallelism.
#' @param logging_level (string)  Set the logging level.
#' Options (ordered from less logging to more logging): critical, error, warning, info, debug
#' @param return_incorrect_results (boolean)  Many models are not created to be able to provide question -- answering, so this setting
#' stops them from returning incorrect results.
#' @param topk (integer) (int)  Indicates number of possible answer span(s) to get from the model output.
#' @param doc_stride (integer)   If the context is too long to fit with the question for the model, it will be split into overlapping chunks.
#' This setting controls the overlap size.
#' @param max_answer_len (integer)  Max answer size to be extracted from the modelâ€™s output.
#' @param max_seq_len (integer)  The max total sentence length (context + question) in tokens of each chunk passed to the model.
#'  If needed, the context is split in chunks (using doc_stride as overlap).
#' @param max_question_len (integer)   The max question length after tokenization. It will be truncated if needed.
#' @param handle_impossible_answer (boolean)  Whether or not impossible is accepted as an answer.
#' @param set_seed (Integer) Set seed.
#' @return Answers.
